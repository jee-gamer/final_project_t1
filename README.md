Advisor is a subclass of Faculty
and is in the same file

Being a Faculty means you don't advise any project. <br />
so normally every faculty should be an advisor. <br />
an Advisor can advise multiple project at once. <br />
an Advisor and a Faculty can evaluate multiple project at once. <br />

There are 2 faculty/advisor needed for evaluation.

A faculty/advisor can read multiple request at once but can only accept one at a time. <br />
Also can only evaluate one project at a time (as in one per action)
